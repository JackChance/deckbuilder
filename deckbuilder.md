tabletop deck builder prototype

Setting:

Based primarily in Seattle, 2060
There's technology and magic, but it's set on Earth. So no elves or dwarves, but there could be sentient robots.
Inspirations from Hearthstone, Shadowrun, and Overwatch
Scifi with strong heroes and some fantasy elements.
- nile corp.
    HQ in seattle
    owns all of cascadia, including Seattle
    secret ties to magic and egyptian gods
    (actually amazon)

Resources:

There is one resource: Power. Power is like mana in Hearthstone. Not having multiple kinds of mana is a design choice to avoid the "oops I drew land" problem.

Cards should always give the player more options and actions. Cards should not ever just be math (+2 power).

Card text should always be short and to the point. If there is a complex action that needs to take place, design a keyword and put the keyword in the rules.

Cards of different types could be equipment (a software program a decker hero can use) or enemies (a black ICE).

Heroes:

10 Heroes are available
Heroes each have a unique power that costs resources to use and helps you get cards
Heroes have different amounts of life
Heroes have different amounts of movement
Heroes get different starting cards
There are no passive abilities or free abilities. Everything is either cards or costs something.
Most heroes are good at two resources, some specilize in just one.

Example heroes:

Chip
- Has 3 life
- Has 2 speed
- Starts with 1 red, 3 blue, 1 black, 1 white
- Power: Spend 2 blue. Reveal a card at your location.

Design Goals:

- Make the game easy to understand. If I'm at the table next to you at Mox Boarding House, I should be able to easily understand if you're winning or losing, just by watching you play.
- Make different levels of difficulty baked into the villians / monsters.
- Make the heroes feel "Overpowered" without actually breaking the game.
- Make it so that the team needs to share resources to win.

Game Winning Condition:

Every game is presented as a mission with a goal. If you finish the mission, you win the game.

If you lose all your life, your hero dies. You pick a new hero, but you start with a fresh deck.


Locations:

There are many locations for your heroes to visit. Locations are where players start working on completing their mission. Your character can visit as many locations as they can reach with their speed in a turn.

Locations come from the location deck and are laid out in a straight line. You get 5 locations at the start of the game.

Gameplay:

At the beginning of each turn you draw a number of cards from the resource deck and put them face down above each location, from left to right. If a location already has a card, then add it to the next location.

As the game goes on, you will draw more location cards from the location deck and place them on the left side of the board.

In fig 1-1, we have a blank board with 5 locations.

fig 1-1
```
|--|  |--|  |--|  |--|  |--|
```

In fig 1-2, we drew 3 cards and put them down.

fig 1-2
```
 ==    ==    ==
|--|  |--|  |--|  |--|  |--|
```

In fig 1-3, we drew 3 more cards and put them down.

fig 1-3
```
 ==
 ==    ==    ==    ==    ==
|--|  |--|  |--|  |--|  |--|
```

In fig 1-4, we drew 1 location card and put it on the left side of the board.

fig 1-4
```
       ==
       ==    ==    ==    ==    ==
|--|  |--|  |--|  |--|  |--|  |--|
```
In fig 1-5, we drew 3 more cards and put them down.

fig 1-5
```
 ==    ==    ==
 ==    ==    ==    ==    ==    ==
|--|  |--|  |--|  |--|  |--|  |--|
```
After the cards are put on the board, each player takes a turn.

At the start of your turn you draw up to 5 cards in your hand.

Next, you move your character and play cards. You can move as many location spaces as your chracter has movement.

At the start of the game, you have 3 locations and you can choose anywhere for your hero to start.

Chip is going to start at the left side. He has 2 movement and five cards.

```
 ==    ==    ==
|--|  |--|  |--|
  X
```

Chip uses one of his cards. Reveal, +1 (white) is the text.

Reveal is a special ability that some cards have that allow you to flip over a card at your location. So Chip reveals the card.

```
 rr    ==    ==
|--|  |--|  |--|
  X
```

Now all the players can see that the card is a Smartlink Rifle (red). It costs 3 (white) to buy.

Chip continues his turn to the next area, and plays another copy of the same card. Reveal, +1 (white).

```
 rr    rr    ==
|--|  |--|  |--|
        X
```

It's a fireball spell. It costs 6 (blue) to buy.

Chip plays another card, this time it does +1 (white) +1 (blue). Then chip moves back to the first area, and spends his white resources to buy the Smartlink Rifle.

He puts the Smartlink Rifle in his discard pile and then ends his turn. His unused resource, in this case, +1 (blue) is thrown away.

```
       rr    ==
|--|  |--|  |--|
  X
```

1. Getting Started
You pick your hero, get your starting cards. Shuffle the location deck and draw cards until you have 3 locations without entry costs.
